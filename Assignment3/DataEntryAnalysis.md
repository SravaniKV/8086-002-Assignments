# Description:
In this assignmnet we were provided with the datasets(3 files) providing the study of 2 species of zooplankton across multiple years.
The type of zooplankton they studied is called rotifers generally, and specifically the genus Conochilus, in which groups of individual
rotifers stick together in colonies. The investigators plan to repeat this study for several more years.

# Task 1 -Issues identified:
1.  In zoop -temp.xlsx file which shows the data from station B has the comment line "Station B is in a shallower southern arm of the lake,
see yellow notebook for map and details".But, there is no yellow notbook for map and details.  
2. The units of measurements of the columns in the files are not provided.Like temperature not sure if it is C/F.
3. There is no details about the time at which the data was collected. There are only details of the date on which they were collected and 
so it is not possible to investigate on day and night distribution samples of specimen.
4. Not all columns are defined. For example in the file Pond2010.xlsx there is a column name 'z' , but no info was provided about that.
5. Some of the data in files are -ve values like, in the file zoop- temp.xlsx there are cells with -ve values in the column Chippo #/L.
6. Some of the rows in the file are in different colour like red, but no information was given why they were different from other rows.
7. The graphs provided in the files doesnt have the y-axis and x-axis defined , but when we click on the graph the corresponidng columns are getting highlighted in the excel.
8. The column definitions are abbrevated and thy are not explained anywhere, So it leads to multiple assumptions and mis interpretations of the data.
9. The pond2010.xlsx contains the data of 2010 where as the other files has the data collected in 2011, though the study was conducted over several years, i think there should be some additional information provided in order to integrate the different years file and make the analysis.

# Task2 - Solutions for the Issues identified in Task 1
Suggest a new system for organization. Create a table in your Markdown document showing a potential template for later years of data collection that would address the problems you identified in #task1. 

1. Provide the information on yellow notes and also the links for the maps and details.
2. Units of measurements for the columns can  be included along with the column names in the excel files.
3. There can be column
